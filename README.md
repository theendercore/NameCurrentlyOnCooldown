Simple mod to show held item cooldown on the crosshair. With many ways to customize the way it looks!

---

## How work?

When you hold an item that is on cooldown, it shows a little bar above the crosshair. And it works for both the main
hand and offhand.

## Configuration?

The Mod is very configurable. You can change where the bars render, if the bar render for the main hand, offhand or
both. And you can also change how the bar looks like (with a resource pack).
